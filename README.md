# number_guessing_game

This is just a small **_javascript_** program used to reinforce looping structure basics for truecoders.io.

1. A random integer is selected between 1 and 100.
2. A user inputs a guess.
3. JavaScript logic lets the user know if their guess is greater or less than the random number.
4. Eventually, the user either guesses the correct number or hits the lose condition (10 turns).
